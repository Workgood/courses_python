f you must blink, do it now,” he says as he begins. Then, using a guitar and a little magic, he brings sheets of paper to life as characters that act out a story. That narrative is a miniature version of the movie’s plot, which is the first of Laika’s films to be directed by its president and chief executive, Travis Knight.
Using one frame from the film, here is a closer look at how the origami sequence came together, including commentary from Mr. Knight and one of the animators, Kevin Parry.
1. Kubo electrifies a crowd with his samurai tale. “The deeper I got into the movie, the more of myself I saw in this kid,” Mr. Knight said. “He’s an artist, he’s a storyteller, he’s a musician, and he’s an animator, really.”
Kubo’s design stands in sharp contrast to the perfect geometric shapes of the fantasy paper figures. For the design of Kubo and the other human characters, the filmmakers were inspired by dolls from the late Edo period in Japan; the period ran from the early 1600s to the mid-1800s.
Those dolls were historically made from cloth, wood, lacquer paper and human hair. So the animators used human hair on Kubo, with a silicon coat combed through it for durability.
